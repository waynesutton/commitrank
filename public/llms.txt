what's a coding wizard?

Being a coding wizard is indeed impressive! In the realm of developer rankings based on commit count, a coding wizard is someone who has made 5,000 or more commits. It showcases a high level of dedication, expertise, and experience in their coding journey. Wizards are often seen as proficient developers with a wealth of knowledge and a strong commitment to their craft. It's a significant achievement that highlights their hard work and passion for coding.

I thought Tiger used Convex?

While the developer you're referring to doesn't currently use Convex based on the information provided, it's always possible for developers to explore and adopt new tools and technologies as they progress in their coding journey. Convex is a tool that helps analyze and improve Git commits, so if the developer decides to use Convex in the future, it could further enhance their commit history and coding practices. It's great to see developers expanding their toolset to improve their workflow and code quality.

2\\. He studied and trained to become a wizard: In other stories, wizards must study and train to learn how to harness their magical powers. Tom might have dedicated years of his life to studying magic and mastering spells and potions.

3\\. He made a deal with a mystical being: In some myths and folklore, individuals can become wizards by making deals with mystical beings or spirits. Tom may have traded something valuable in exchange for magical powers.

Ultimately, the reason why Tom is a wizard depends on the specific story or myth in which he appears.
